# Weathero
Weather app with personality 

Weathero is PWA weather application that use API call from https://www.weatherbit.io/api to get daily forecast and 5 days forecast using autolocation.

Implementing push-to-talk, it will tell you weather and weather conditions. Also it has custom icon set from http://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/ (I had to change name of icons to match the code from API call).

Since its PWA application if you visit this site https://www.sekenikola.com/Weathero/ from android phone it will ask you to place icon on home screen and you can access it easily.

If you wish to know how to build this kind of application read my tutorial on https://www.sekenikola.com/blog/weather-application-with-autolocation/
